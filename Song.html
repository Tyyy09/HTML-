<h2>Lyrics</h2>
        <p>[Verse1]</p>
        <p>If you ever leave me, baby</p>
        <p>Leave some morphine at my door</p>
        <p>'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication</p>
        <p>To realize what we used to have</p>
        <p>We don't have it anymore</p>
        <p>There's no religion that could save me</p>
        <p>No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh</p>
        <p>So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'</p>
        <p>To keep you by side</p>
        <p>To keep you from walkin' out the door</p>
        <br>
        <p>[Chorus]</p>
        <p>'Cause there'll be no sunlight, if I lose you, baby</p>
        <p>There'll be no clear skies, if I lose you, baby</p>
        <p>Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same</p>
        <p>If you walk away, everyday it'll rain, rain, rain</p>
        <br>
        <p>[Verse2]</p>
        <p>I'll never be your mother's favorite</p>
        <p>Your daddy can't even look at me in the eye</p>
        <p>Ohh, If i was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing</p>
        <p>Sayin', "There goes my little girl Walkin' with that troublesome guy"</p>
        <p>But they're just afraid of somethin' they can't understand</p>
        <p>Ohh, but, Little darlin', watch me change thier mindss</p>
        <p>Yeah, for you, i'll try,i'll try,i'll try,i'll try</p>
        <br>
        <p>[Chorus}</p>
        <p>[Chorus]</p>
        <p>'Cause there'll be no sunlight, if I lose you, baby</p>
        <p>There'll be no clear skies, if I lose you, baby</p>
        <p>Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same</p>
        <p>If you walk away, everyday it'll rain, rain, rain</p>
        <br>
        <p>[Refrain]</p>
        <p>I'll pick these broken pieces 'till i'm bleedin' if that'll make it right</p>
        <br>
        <p>[Chorus]</p>
        <p>'Cause there'll be no sunlight, if I lose you, baby</p>
        <p>There'll be no clear skies, if I lose you, baby</p>
        <p>Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same</p>
        <p>If you walk away, everyday it'll rain, rain, rain</p>
